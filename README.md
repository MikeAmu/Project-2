# Project-2
## LEMP Web stack

This is project is the implementation of a web stack, similar to the LAMP stack implemented in Project-1. However, a different web server - `NGINX`, which is also very popular and widely used by many websites in the Internet will be used.

- Linux - Operating system 
- (E) Nginx - Web server 
- MySQL - Database 
- PHP - Programming language

To complete this project, I setup and configured a fresh EC2 instance with Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM).

I used Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) to establish connection with my Ubuntu server.
